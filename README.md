#Activity1-Bank Churn Prediction
This project predicts customer churn in a bank based on various customer attributes. It uses machine learning algorithms to classify customers who are likely to churn (exit the bank) and those who are likely to stay.
#Project Overview
Customer churn is a significant issue for businesses, and predicting which customers are likely to churn can help businesses take necessary actions to retain them. This project uses a dataset of bank customers and builds a machine learning model to predict whether a customer will churn based on their characteristics such as age, balance, number of products, etc.
#Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Churn_Modelling.csv file, which contains information about 10,000 customers. 
It includes the following columns:
RowNumber: Row index.
